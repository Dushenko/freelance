I am still hosting to this day. Their support is very helpful, one time I was in need of assistance with a SSL certificate and the chat literally went on for over 2,5 hours. Only downside I can think of is that sometimes their live chat is super busy and it can take a while before you can connect. Also 2 times my domains did not register correctly. Other than that the best web host in my opinion.</p>

                        <p class="comment__text">With only 2 hours of downtime over the course of this review and a total of 36 outages, HostGator cloud is the eleventh most reliable host that we’ve ever reviewed and they don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

                        <p class="comment__text">Considering the improved performance and additional features (which we will get to in a second) that come standard with HostGator’s Cloud hosting plan, their basic pricing tiers are fairly competitive. If you ask ten different people to explain what it means in plain English, you’ll get ten different, jargon-filled answers that will probably make your ears bleed and your eyes glaze over.</p>
                        <p class="comment__text">Words like “net bit rate”, “throughput” and “throttling” leave their lips and you’ll be left with little-to-no mental bandwidth (pun very much intended) to process what the heck just happened or what exactly you’re paying for with your soon-to-be hosting provider.</p>

                      <p class="comment__text">Your page loading time is one of the single most important factors in maintaining a high-quality and user-friendly website.</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">According to market research, if your website doesn’t load within 5 seconds, you will lose more than 74% of your mobile site traffic! Conversely, by decreasing your page load times, you can increase traffic and conversions by more than 74%. Coincidence? I think not!</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">Luckily, if you choose to trust HostGator Cloud with your web hosting, you’ll never have to worry about losing a potential customer to sluggish load times again.</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">With a speed less than 419 ms (more than 50% faster than the industry average of 890 ms), HostGator Cloud is one of the fastest and most affordable hosting providers that we’ve ever reviewed.

I am still hosting to this day. Their support is very helpful, one time I was in need of assistance with a SSL certificate and the chat literally went on for over 2,5 hours. Only downside I can think of is that sometimes their live chat is super busy and it can take a while before you can connect. Also 2 times my domains did not register correctly. Other than that the best web host in my opinion.</p>

I am still hosting to this day. Their support is very helpful, one time I was in need of assistance with a SSL certificate and the chat literally went on for over 2,5 hours. Only downside I can think of is that sometimes their live chat is super busy and it can take a while before you can connect. Also 2 times my domains did not register correctly. Other than that the best web host in my opinion.</p>

                        <p class="comment__text">With only 2 hours of downtime over the course of this review and a total of 36 outages, HostGator cloud is the eleventh most reliable host that we’ve ever reviewed and they don’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

If you ask ten different people to explain what it means in plain English, you’ll get ten different, jargon-filled answers that will probably make your ears bleed and your eyes glaze over.</p>
                        <p class="comment__text">Words like “net bit rate”, “throughput” and “throttling” leave their lips and you’ll be left with little-to-no mental bandwidth (pun very much intended) to process what the heck just happened or what exactly you’re paying for with your soon-to-be hosting provider.</p>

                      <p class="comment__text">Your page loading time is one of the single most important factors in maintaining a high-quality and user-friendly website.</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">According to market research, if your website doesn’t load within 5 seconds, you will lose more than 74% of your mobile site traffic! Conversely, by decreasing your page load times, you can increase traffic and conversions by more than 74%. Coincidence? I think not!</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">Luckily, if you choose to trust HostGator Cloud with your web hosting, you’ll never have to worry about losing a potential customer to sluggish load times again.</p>
                      <p class="comment__text">With a speed less than 419 ms (more than 50% faster than the industry average of 890 ms), HostGator Cloud is one of the fastest and most affordable hosting providers that we’ve ever reviewed.
